    <h2 id="background">Background</h2>

    <p>In January 2016, members of the <abbr>WCAG</abbr> Working Group started a
    discussion on how errors related to the use of
    <abbr>WAI</abbr>-<abbr>ARIA</abbr> relate to the two success criteria in
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/#ensure-compat"><abbr>WCAG</abbr> 2.0's Guideline 4.1</a>. 
    More specifically, the question was whether any <abbr>ARIA</abbr>-related errors
    could be considered as violations of <abbr>WCAG</abbr> Success Criterion (<abbr>SC</abbr>) 4.1.1.
    This document responds to that discussion.
    </p>

    <h2 id="wcag-gl4"><abbr>WCAG</abbr> 2.0 Guideline 4</h2>

    <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/#ensure-compat-parses"><abbr>SC</abbr> 4.1</a> says the following</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong class="sc-handle">4.1.1 Parsing:</strong> 
        In content implemented using markup languages, 
        elements have complete start and end tags, 
        elements are nested according to their specifications, 
        elements do not contain duplicate attributes, 
        and any IDs are unique, 
        except where the specifications allow these features. 
        (Level A)      
      </p>
      <p class="note"><em>Note: </em>
        Start and end tags that are missing a critical character in their formation, 
        such as a closing angle bracket or a mismatched attribute value quotation mark are not complete.
      </p>
      <p class="copyright">(Copyright <abbr>W3C</abbr>.)</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The success criterion was written in order to protect assistive technologies (<abbr>AT</abbr>),
    especially screen readers, against markup errors that would require automatic repair functionality.
    Assistive technologies rely on the data exposed through the browser's accessibility <abbr>API</abbr>
    but perform additional parsing on top of that. This additional burden should not be made heavier
    by errors that are fairly easy to fix in the markup (<abbr>i.e.</abbr> by web site authors)
    but much harder to fix automatically (<abbr>i.e.</abbr> by <abbr>AT</abbr>).</p>

    <p>The <abbr>SC</abbr> was written <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html401/"><abbr>HTML</abbr> 4.01</a> 
      (published in December 1999) was still the most
     up-to-date non-<abbr>XML</abbr> version of <abbr>HTML</abbr>, and 
     <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/"><abbr>XHTML</abbr> 1.0 (Second Edition, August 2002)</a> and 
     <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xhtml11-20010531/"><abbr>XHTML</abbr> 1.1 - Module-based <abbr>XHTML</abbr> (May 2001)</a> 
     were the most up-to-date <abbr>XML</abbr>-based versions of <abbr>HTML</abbr>,
     the <abbr>W3C</abbr>'s Markup Activity was still working on 
     <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-xhtml2-20060726/"><abbr>XHMTL</abbr> 2.0</a>,
     and the Protocols and Formats Working Group was still working on <abbr>WAI</abbr>-<abbr>ARIA</abbr>.
     <abbr>SVG</abbr> and <abbr>SMIL</abbr>, both <abbr>XML</abbr>-based, had been around for a while.
     (The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-html5-20080122/">first working draft of <abbr>HTML</abbr>5</a>
     had not yet been published when
     <abbr>WCAG</abbr> published it's
     <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2007/WD-WCAG20-20071211/">second Last Call Working Draft</a>.)
    </p>

    <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/#tech-identify-grammar"><abbr>WCAG</abbr> 1.0 checkpoint 3.2 required valid markup</a>, 
      but this requirement seemed too strict. 
      Many people felt that requiring valid markup would draw too many resources 
      towards fixing markup errors that had no impact on accessibility.
      (Sidenote: Back in 2005, 
      <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2005OctDec/0442.html">not all <abbr>W3C</abbr> specifications had a conformance section that required valid markup</a>.)
      <!-- 
      The <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4.01 specification defines 
      <dfn><abbr>HTML</abbr> document</dfn> as 
      <q cite="https://www.w3.org/TR/html401/conform.html#h-4.1">an <abbr>SGML</abbr> document that meets the constraints of this specification</q>
      (see <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html401/conform.html#h-4.1"><abbr>HTML</abbr> 4.01's conformance section</a></cite>),
      but points out that 
      <q cite="https://www.w3.org/TR/html401/sgml/intro.html#h-19.1">validation, although useful and highly recommended, does not guarantee that a document fully conforms to the HTML 4 specification</q>
      (see <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html401/sgml/intro.html#h-19.1">Document Validation</a></cite>).
      -->
    </p>
    <p>Requiring well-formed markup was considered as an alternative requirement
      but was rejected because well-formed markup is a concept that only applies to <abbr>XML</abbr>-based content.
      Well-formed markup has no meaning in the context of <abbr title="Standard Generalised Markup Languages">SGML</abbr>-based languages
      such as <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4.01 and its predecessors.
      <!-- Attempt to come up with something like "well-formedness" for SGML-based HTML: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2005AprJun/0806.html -->
      It would later also become meaningless to <abbr>HTML</abbr>5, which is not based on <abbr>SGML</abbr> or <abbr>XML</abbr>.
    </p>
    <p>For these reasons, the <abbr>WCAG</abbr> working group identified four requirements
      that would apply to any web content that uses elements and attributes.
      The next few paragraphs will discuss these four requirements in more detail.
    </p>

    <h2 id="gl4-wai-aira"><abbr>WAI</abbr>-<abbr>ARIA</abbr> and <abbr>WCAG</abbr> 2.0 Guideline 4.1</h2>
    <p><abbr>WAI</abbr>-<abbr>ARIA</abbr> is not a markup language like
      <abbr>HTML</abbr> or <abbr>SVG</abbr>. 
      You cannot implement web content using only <abbr>ARIA</abbr>, so <abbr>WCAG</abbr> <abbr>SC</abbr> 4.1.1 does not apply to <abbr>ARIA</abbr> <em>directly</em>.
      However, <abbr>WCAG</abbr> <abbr>SC</abbr> 4.1.1 does not identify requirements for web <em>standards</em>; it identifies requiremnts for web <em>content</em>.
      <abbr>WAI</abbr>-<abbr>ARIA</abbr> is always used in web content that is implemented using other web standards
      (<abbr>HTML</abbr>, <abbr>SVG</abbr>, &hellip;).
      All of <abbr>WCAG</abbr> applies to content that uses <abbr>HTML</abbr> + <abbr>WAI</abbr>-<abbr>ARIA</abbr>,
      even when that content is generated by means of client-side scripts.
